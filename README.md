# lamax-x6
scripts for video enhancement

## Idea

Set of scripts for automatic video enhancement of Lamax Action X6 cam.

All based on opensource and created for command line use.


1. convert MOV to MP4 in high quality
2. combine several video files to one (30min + 30min + 24min == 84min)
3. cut approx 3 sec from the beginning and the end (start and stop procedure)
4. lens correction, remove fish eye
5. denoise, increase saturation
6. stabilization
7. use sound equalizer (noise reduction)
8. convert to expected quality (file size vs quality)
 


## Done

1. convert MOV to MP4 in high quality

   copy video lossless, transcode audio to AAC, copy metadata of input video (created date, etc)

2. combine several video files to one (30min + 30min + 24min == 84min)

   done using MP4Box

4. lens correction, remove fish eye

   done using method "try and check"


## TODO

3. cut approx 3 sec from the beginning and the end (start and stop procedure)
5. denoise, increase saturation
6. stabilization
7. use sound equalizer (noise reduction)
8. convert to expected quality (file size vs quality)
